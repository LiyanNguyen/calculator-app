### My Process
- Design the Mobile viewport WHILE desinging the Desktop Viewport at the same time using
- Design the flex/grid system, making sure to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct
- Add in all the other HTML content
- Finished up all the CSS designs

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned
- More Flexbox
- More JavaScript
- Theme Switcher using classes on the root file of the CSS
- Probably better to specify the widht and height of the small UI elements first rather than the big ones
- The containers of UI element should just be paddings - their width and height is defined by the smaller elements inside as flex items
